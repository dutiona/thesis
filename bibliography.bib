                  which most classes and procedures are parameterized, thus
                  leading to the construction of general and efficient
                  software components. We demonstrate that some design

                  paradigm while handling operation polymorphism by
                  parametric polymorphism. We thus preserve their modularity

                  penalty due to their dynamic behavior, which is a critical

                  pattern recognition are not reusable; to run an algorithm
                  on particular data, one usually has either to rewrite the
                  algorithm or to manually ``copy, paste, and modify''. This
                  is due to the lack of genericity of the programming
                  paradigm used to implement the libraries. In this paper, we
                  present a recent paradigm that allows algorithms to be
                  written once and for all and to accept input of various
                  types. Moreover, this total reusability can be obtained
                  with a very comprehensive writing and without significant
                  cost at execution, compared to a dedicated algorithm. This
                  new paradigm is called ``generic programming'' and is fully
                  supported by the C++ language. We show how this paradigm
                  can be applied to image processing and pattern recognition
                  routines. The perspective of our work is the creation of a
                  generic library.}

  abstract      = {Classical (unbounded) genericity in \Cxx{}03 defines the
                  interactions between generic data types and algorithms in
                  terms of concepts. Concepts define the requirements over a
                  type (or a parameter) by expressing constraints on its
                  methods and dependent types (typedefs). The upcoming
                  \Cxx{}0x standard will promote concepts from abstract
                  entities (not directly enforced by the tools) to language
                  constructs, enabling compilers and tools to perform
                  additional checks on generic constructs as well as enabling
                  new features (e.g., concept-based overloading). Most modern
                  languages support this notion of signature on generic
                  types. However, generic types built on other types and
                  relying on concepts to both ensure type conformance and
                  drive code specialization, restrain the interface and the
                  implementation of the newly created type: specific methods
                  and associated types not mentioned in the concept will not
                  be part of the new type. The paradigm of concept-based
                  genericity lacks the required semantics to transform types
                  while retaining or adapting their intrinsic capabilities.
                  We present a new form of semantically-enriched genericity
                  allowing static generic type transformations through a
                  simple form of type introspection based on type metadata
                  called properties. This approach relies on a new Static
                  \Cxx Object-Oriented Programming (SCOOP) paradigm, and is
                  adapted to the creation of generic and efficient libraries,
                  especially in the field of scientific computing. Our
                  proposal uses a metaprogramming facility built into a \Cxx
                  library called Static, and doesn't require any language
                  extension nor additional processing (preprocessor,
                  transformation tool).},

                  n\'ecessit\'e d'avoir des impl\'ementations rapides,

  abstract      = {In the context of software engineering for image
                  processing (IP), we consider the notion of reusability of
                  algorithms. In many software tools, an algorithm's
                  implementation often depends on the type of processed data.
                  In a broad definition, discrete digital images may have
                  various forms---classical 2D images, 3D volumes,
                  non-regular graphs, cell complexes, and so on---thus
                  leading to a combinatorial explosion of the theoretical
                  number of implementations.\\ Generic programming (GP) is a
                  framework suited to the development of reusable software
                  tools. We present a programming paradigm based on GP
                  designed for the creation of scientific software such as IP
                  tools. This approach combines the benefits of reusability,
                  expressive power, extensibility, and efficiency.\\ We then
                  propose a software architecture for IP using this
                  programming paradigm based on a generic IP library. The
                  foundations of this framework define essential IP concepts,
                  enabling the development of algorithms compatible with many
                  image types.\\ We finally present a strategy to build
                  high-level tools on top of this library, such as bridges to
                  dynamic languages or graphical user interfaces. This
                  mechanism has been designed to preserve the genericity and
                  efficiency of the underlying software tools, while making
                  them simpler to use and more flexible.},

                  frameworks are said to be generic: they allow users to
                  write reusable algorithms compatible with many input image
                  types. However, this design choice is often made at the
                  expense of performance. We present an approach to preserve
                  efficiency in a generic image processing framework, by
                  leveraging data types features. Variants of generic
                  algorithms taking advantage of image types properties can
                  be defined, offering an adjustable trade-off between
                  genericity and efficiency. Our experiments show that these
                  generic optimizations can match dedicated code in terms of

              play a more central role than in conventional software library
              technology or in the object-oriented programming paradigm. Our
              approach is to consider algorithms first, decide what types and
              access operations they need for efficient execution, and regard
              the types and operations as formal parameters that can be
              instantiated in many different ways, as long as the actual
              parameters satisfy the assumptions on which the correctness and
              efficiency of the algorithms are based. The means by which
              instantiation is carried out is language dependent; in the C + +
              examples in this paper, we instantiate generic algorithms by
              constructing classes that define the needed types and access
              operations. By use of such compile-time techniques and careful
              attention to algorithmic issues, it is possible to construct

                the most suitable architectures for image processing
                applications. However, accelerating algorithms using FPGAs is a
                time-consuming task and needs expertise. Whereas the recent
                advancements in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) promise to solve this
                problem, today's HLS tools require apt hardware descriptions of
                algorithms to be able to provide favorable implementations. A
                solution is developing highly parameterizable and optimized HLS
                libraries for the fundamental image processing components.
                Another solution is providing a higher level of abstraction in
                the form of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and a corresponding
                efficient back end for hardware design. In this paper, we
                provide a highly efficient and parameterizable C++ library for
                image processing applications, which would be the cornerstone
                for both approaches. In our library, nodes of a stream-based
                data flow graph can be described as C++ objects for specified
                functions, and the whole application can be efficiently

  abstract  = "Multiple dispatch–the selection of a function to be invoked based
              on the dynamic type of two or more arguments–is a solution to
              several classical problems in object-oriented programming. Open
              multi-methods generalize multiple dispatch towards open-class
              extensions, which improve separation of concerns and provisions
              for retroactive design. We present the rationale, design,
              implementation, performance, programming guidelines, and
              experiences of working with a language feature, called open
              multi-methods, for C++. Our open multi-methods support both
              repeated and virtual inheritance. Our call resolution rules
              generalize both virtual function dispatch and overload resolution
              semantics. After using all information from argument types, these
              rules can resolve further ambiguities by using covariant return
              types. Care was taken to integrate open multi-methods with
              existing C++ language features and rules. We describe a model
              implementation and compare its performance and space requirements
              to existing open multi-method extensions and work-around
              techniques for C++. Compared to these techniques, our approach is
              simpler to use, catches more user mistakes, and resolves more
              ambiguities through link-time analysis, is comparable in memory
              usage, and runs significantly faster. In particular, the runtime
              cost of calling an open multi-method is constant and less than the
              cost of a double dispatch (two virtual function calls). Finally,
              we provide a sketch of a design for open multi-methods in the
              presence of dynamic loading and linking of libraries."

              processing which provides resources for essential digital image

              library is used to teach both object-oriented software engineering

              be accessed from independent specialized applications through its

              encapsulated. First of all it is used as the inner part of an
              integrated environment designed for students and researchers in
              the field of digital image processing. This software component was
              built aiming for both portability and extendibility. It contains
              attributes and methods that allow for a wide range of digital
              image processing algorithms: point and geometric operations;
              filter, edge detection, segmentation and texture operations; and
              fast Fourier transforms, discrete cosine transforms, and wavelet
              and Gabor transformations. All these can be used for image

                  Processing library, each one may expect different services

                  production-quality algorithms, some may look for a large tool
                  set, while others may look for extensibility and genericity to

                  Processing library designer, it is difficult to conciliate
                  genericity, efficiency and simplicity at the same time. Modern
                  C++ (post 2011) brings new features for library developers
                  that will help designing a software solution combining those

  abstract    = "Functional and logic programming are the most important declarative programming paradigms, and interest
                in combining them has grown over the last decade. However, integrated functional logic languages are
                currently not widely used. This is due to the fact that the operational principles are not well
                understood and many different evaluation strategies have been proposed which resulted in many different
                functional logic languages. To overcome this situation, we propose the functional logic language Curry
                which is intended to become a standard language in this area. It includes important ideas of existing
                functional logic languages and recent developments, and combines the most important features of
                functional and logic languages. Thus, Curry can be the basis to combine the currently separated research
                efforts of the functional and logic programming communities and to boost declarative programming in
                general. Moreover, since functions provide for more efficient evaluation strategies and are a
                declarative replacement of some impure features of Prolog (in particular, pruning operators), Curry can
                be also used as a declarative successor of Prolog."

              special focus on hierarchical methods capable of handling large amount of data. The main aspects of
              hierarchical graph analysis addressed in Higra are the construction of hierarchical representations
              (agglomerative clustering, mathematical morphology hierarchies, etc.), the analysis and processing of such
              representations (filtering, clustering, characterization, etc.), and their assessment. Higra targets a
              large audience, from students and practitioners wanting an accessible library for quickly experimenting,
              to researchers developing new methods for hierarchical analysis of graph data. Higra is a generic toolbox
              for graph analysis and can be utilized in a large variety of application fields like machine learning,
              data science, pattern analysis and computer vision. Moreover, it contains an image analysis module easing
              the handling of pixel grid graphs by providing efficient algorithms dedicated to this field."
